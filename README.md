## How to play:
Use a mouse/trackpad to move the platform at the bottom of the screen to catch balls.

## Interaction:
The player interfaces with the game by controlling the platform which catches falling objects via a mouse, moving left and right on the x-axis. Audio and visuals are used to help convey events to the player; the goal is that the player should be able to understand what is occurring in the game solely off sound or visuals. Depending on the playerâ€™s capability to score, the end-screen will alter both visually and audibly to match. Falling objects interact with the user-controlled platform and bottom of the screen accordingly.
